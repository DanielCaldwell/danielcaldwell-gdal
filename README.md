# Docker Container
A location to store my Dockerfiles for running gdal. Useful for running gdal when you want to without installing it and messing with the host machine's gdal. 

# Docker Hosting

This container is hosted on DockerHub at: https://hub.docker.com/r/danielcaldwell/gdal/

If you have any suggestions, please submit a pull request. 

# Scripts

build.sh - will build the container locally
run.sh - will run the container with bash
run_windows.sh - will use winpty to run it on the windows command prompt
